# 🌳 What structure do I propose?

# ⁇ Why ⁇

Because you need to be structured at the moment to set up a new project, assets need to be outside the main folder because you don't need extra size. 
Inside the src main folder, you have some folders with the same "status" like app, config, constants, hooks, services, theme, utils. 
Inside the app folder, you have components (global re-utilizable components, if the component only affects one specific screen they must be inside the component folder inside the specific screen for example `login/components/Form`. Then have a context, navigation of the entire app and the screens folder.
And remember one style file by folder. For example =>
